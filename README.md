This tool never modifies your files — it only copies and compares them.
# AutomationZ Config Diff [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/R6R51QD7BU)

**This tool was originally built for my DayZ server to compare backups of configuration files and folders before and after making changes.
By creating snapshots of files at different moments in time, I can easily compare a working state with a broken one and see exactly what changed in a clear report.
When something breaks, I simply download the current files, create two snapshots, run a comparison, and immediately know what was added, removed, or modified.
No DayZ mod is required.
Although designed with DayZ servers in mind, this tool works for any game server, website, application, or system that uses folders and files — making it a universal configuration diff and troubleshooting tool.**

**AutomationZ Config Diff** is a lightweight **snapshot + compare (diff)** tool for server admins and modders.
It helps you quickly answer the question:

> **“What changed between version A and version B?”**

It’s perfect for debugging **broken loot**, **wrong settings**, **DayZ updates**, **wipes**, or accidental edits.

✅ Works on **Windows / Linux / macOS**  
✅ Creates clean **Markdown diff reports** you can share  
✅ Beginner-friendly workflow

## What this tool is for

### DayZ server admins
- Compare `cfggameplay.json`, `types.xml`, `events.xml`
- Track changes after updates, wipes, or mod edits

### Any folder comparison
- Snapshot folders before changes
- Snapshot again after
- Diff to instantly see what broke

---

## How it works

1. **init** – creates `config/settings.json`
2. **snapshot** – copies tracked files into `snapshots/`
3. **diff** – compares two snapshots and writes a Markdown report

Nothing is modified. Files are only copied and compared.
