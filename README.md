# AutomationZ Config Diff
**Build for my DayZ Server to compare backups of files / folders which i make before making changes. 
If i encounter a error i can download the current files make 2 snapshots and compare the snapshots and see the changes made in the report files.
**No DayZ mod** required can be used for any Game / server, website, whatever has folders and files!**

**AutomationZ Config Diff** is a lightweight **snapshot + compare (diff)** tool for server admins and modders.
It helps you quickly answer the question:

> **“What changed between version A and version B?”**

It’s perfect for debugging **broken loot**, **wrong settings**, **DayZ updates**, **wipes**, or accidental edits.

✅ Works on **Windows / Linux / macOS**  
✅ Creates clean **Markdown diff reports** you can share  
✅ Beginner-friendly workflow

## What this tool is for

### DayZ server admins
- Compare `cfggameplay.json`, `types.xml`, `events.xml`
- Track changes after updates, wipes, or mod edits

### Any folder comparison
- Snapshot folders before changes
- Snapshot again after
- Diff to instantly see what broke

---

## How it works

1. **init** – creates `config/settings.json`
2. **snapshot** – copies tracked files into `snapshots/`
3. **diff** – compares two snapshots and writes a Markdown report

Nothing is modified. Files are only copied and compared.
